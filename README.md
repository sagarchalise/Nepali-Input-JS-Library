Nepali Input JS Library.
--------
Library to use with websites for Nepali input with HTML form/input elements.

Most of the codebase are inspired and taken from https://github.com/suvash/NepInputFFExt.

I plan to do the following:
	- standalone library with major browser compatibility
	- jQuery plugin
	- wordpress plugin
	- traditional layout support (if possible)
