Nepali Input JS Library.
--------
Library to use with websites for Nepali input with HTML form/input elements.

Most of the codebase are inspired and taken from https://github.com/suvash/NepInputFFExt.

I plan to do the following:
<ul>
<li>standalone library with major browser compatibility</li>
<li>jQuery plugin</li>
<li>wordpress plugin</li>
<li>traditional layout support (if possible)</li>
</ul>
